# NewChatBar
The new Button Bar for opening chat messages of each type.


v. 0.08 Fixed for Dragon Flight



I am not the original author, I just made this work for Dragon Flight. The original author hasn't been around for a minute.....His name will remain in the TOC and in the Core.lua...........



This is pretty self explanatory on how it works. Each end of the bar can be grabbed by your mouse so you can set it where you want. The position will be saved for the next time you log in. Depending on where you are will determine what channels will be available. Give it a second to load them. If you are in a Guild that channel we automatically be added. And the Officer Channel will be added as well. If you are in Valdrakken a 5th channel will be added for "Services".
